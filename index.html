      <p><i class="fa-solid fa-video"></i> SkateBlok is a community-driven platform where skaters can upload videos of themselves performing tricks and showcase their skills. Users with authority, selected by the skaters themselves, rate the videos, providing tips and encouragement helping skaters progress through different skill levels. Authority users are will skate shop owners and professional skaters chosen by the shops.</p>

      <p><i class="fa-solid fa-map-location-dot"></i> The platform will include a location-based game that encourages skaters to visit skate parks, complete tricks, and earn points. As skaters reach milestones, they receive in-game badges and accolades, as well as real-world prizes from their local skate shops! This system motivates skaters to improve and drives engagement for local skate shops.</p>

      <p><i class="fa-solid fa-rocket"></i> SkateBlok aims to modernize the skateboarding experience, make it fun and interactive, and provide young skaters with an active, engaging outlet. By blending digital rewards with real-world incentives, SkateBlok strengthens the skateboarding community, promotes physical activity, and helps local shops thrive.</p>
    
      <p><i class="fa-solid fa-video"></i>We would like to get participating skateshops and businesses to have a server we build to host their local clubs videos. This will have a display rotating through the videos. It will have storage and a graphics card for processing.</p>
